                            <p class="mb_20 fs_15">Since 2005, a strong, customer-focused approach and relentless
                                pursuit of world-class quality have helped it achieve and maintain leadership in all its
                                main lines of business.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb_50 fs_15">With an international presence, Jia International has offices spread
                                across several African countries. Thrust on international business saw overseas earnings
                                grow significantly. It continues to expand its global footprint, with an office in East
                                Africa.
                                A wide marketing network provides support for these businesses and has established
                                credibility for strong customer support.
                                To respond to these changes in the market dynamics, Jia International has evolved
                                through a phased process of redefinition of its organizational model for growth through
                                higher levels of empowerment. A new organization structure is designed around multiple
                                businesses, that serves the needs of a different set of industries.
                                Jia International, which believes in the fact that "progress must be achieved in harmony
                                with the environment," requires corporate vision embracing commitments to community
                                welfare and environmental protection as a vital component.

                            <p class="mb_15 fs_15">Jia International was formed in 2005, and it is based in Ahmedabad,
                                India. A small start, Roto Master (India), a subsidiary unit of Jia International
                                started having a small engineering workshop with the aim to undertake jobs and provide
                                services to the local industries as well as to manufacture rotational molding machinery
                                and molds, to sell products in the local market. These products succeeded, and Jia
                                International became known as a trustworthy fabricator.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb_15 fs_15">Starting with the sheet metal fabrication work, Jia International
                                quickly took on engineering assignments that were progressively more complex. Today, the
                                company sets global engineering benchmarks in size and complexity.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb_15 fs_15">In 2006 and after, Jia International won orders for rotational
                                molding machinery and molds that shipped to African countries, Middle East countries,
                                and Asian Pacific countries.
                                Somewhere in 2007, Jia International picked up the hand fabrication activity pertaining
                                to the manufacturing of chemical process equipment, ribbon blenders, batch-type solvent
                                extraction, and distillation plants.

                            <p class="mb_15 fs_15">In 2010, Jia International manufactured the vertical axis wind
                                turbine, which remained the benchmark for the company.
                                <br />
                                In 2011, the company entered into the trade business. The firm deals in a range of trade
                                businesses, such as tiles and sanitary wares, building materials, lab-ware disposables,
                                and various kinds of engineering goods.
                                From 2014-2015, the company expanded into the manufacture of DTH Water Well Drilling
                                Rigs, Direct Rotary Water Well Drilling Rig, Blast Hole Drilling Rig, and Diamond Core
                                Wire Line Drilling Rig.
                                Today, Jia International is India's fast-growing and emerging industrial and trade
                                organization with a reputation for technological excellence, high-quality products and
                                services, and strong customer orientation. It is also taking steps to grow its
                                international presence.

                                For an institution, which has grown to remarkable proportions, there cannot and must not
                                be an 'end'. Unlike other stories, the Jia International saga continues.

                                    platform from which our innovative thinking can evolve. Information is gathered
                                    through brainstorming, focus groups, market research, evaluation, creative concepts
                                    and experimentation to provide us with insight into the product and market area and

                                    design concepts are as diverse as possible. Whilst we do find thinking laterally and
                                    out of the box often results in the best ideas, we do ensure that all our concepts
                                    and designs can be translated into brief fulfilling, viable solutions. Concepts are
                                    generated via brainstorming, sketches, basic CAD modeling, sketch models and test
                                    bench amongst other processes.

                                <p class="fs_15">Ergonomics is the study and application of information about humans
                                    that informs and aids the design of the product. It involves studying how most
                                    people interact with the products we are designing so we can ensure the products fit
                                    the user, not have the user adjust to fit the product, often improving safety,
                                    efficiency and comfort. Aesthetics are all about the way the product looks and are
                                    largely responsible for how a new product design captures the market. Ultimately, it
                                    is often the way a product looks that determines its market success, regardless of
                                    its functional advantages. We style our products through sketching, 3D modeling,
                                    continually refining the products aesthetics to appeal to the target market without
                                    sacrificing its function.

                                    <br> We use both physical and virtual models to test functional concepts and product
                                    design solutions, allowing us to continually evaluate and refine an idea. Our

                                    these tests by creating highly accurate model and assembly parts of a product. We
                                    can perform a vast range of tests on these virtual models including stress analysis
                                    and material suitability tests, which coupled with our experience, allow us to make
